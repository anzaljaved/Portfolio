  <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">About Me</h2>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
    Hey! I'm <span className="text-blue-400 font-semibold">M Anzal Javed</span>, a second-year Bachelor of Computer Applications student based in Kochi, Kerala. I'm a passionate developer who enjoys creating meaningful and interactive digital experiences through code.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
    I specialize in frontend development using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React, and I'm currently exploring backend technologies like PHP/SQL and Python Django to build full-stack applications. I'm also deeply interested in Game development, where I combine storytelling, design, and programming to build immersive worlds and experiences.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
    Beyond development, I love sharing knowledge and have conducted seminars for both school and college students on topics like basic Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence. These experiences have fueled my love for learning  and teaching collaboratively.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
    I'm constantly working on sharpening my skills and building creative projects that blend technology with a human touch. Whether it's a game, a utility, or a websiteâ€”my goal is to bring ideas to life with purpose and passion.
